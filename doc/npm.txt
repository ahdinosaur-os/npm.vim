*npm.txt* npm.vim: Run NPM commands in Vim.
          For Vim version 7.x
          By Thomas Allen <thomas@oinksoft.com>

npm.vim makes it easy to run npm commands from Vim. It doesn't have any
interesting features like errorlist integration yet.

=============================================================================
Global Commands

:Npm <command> [options..]                                              *:Npm*

Calls `npm <command> [options]`. Commands can be tab-completed.

=============================================================================
Global Settings                                                 *npm-settings* 


                                                            *g:npm_background*
g:npm_background = 1

If set to non-zero, runs all commands in background (so you lose their
output).

Overridden by g:npm_foreground.
                                                            *g:npm_foreground*
g:npm_background = 1

If set to non-zero, runs commands in foreground. This is the default and is
best for long-running commands like "npm install".

Overrides g:npm_background

                                                       *g:npm_custom_commands*
g:npm_custom_commands = []

If some NPM commands aren't being picked up, add them to this list.
