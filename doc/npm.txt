          For Vim version 7.x
          By Thomas Allen <thomas@oinksoft.com>

npm.vim makes it easy to run npm commands from Vim. It doesn't have any
interesting features like errorlist integration yet.

=============================================================================
Global Commands

:Npm <command> [options..]                                              *:Npm*

Calls `npm <command> [options]`. Commands can be tab-completed.

=============================================================================
Global Settings                                                 *npm-settings*


                                                            *g:npm_background*
g:npm_background = 0

If set to non-zero, runs all commands in background (so you lose their
output).

                                                       *g:npm_custom_commands*
g:npm_custom_commands = []

If some NPM commands aren't being picked up, add them to this list.

                                                         *g:npm_load_commands*
g:npm_load_commands = 0

If set to non-zero, commands for tab completion are loaded at startup rather
than the first time completion is needed.

=============================================================================
